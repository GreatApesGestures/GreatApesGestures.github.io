## Welcome! 

Welcome to **GApS: A Coding Scheme for Great Apes Signals in ELAN**

## Goal

The aim of this manual is to offer a systematic and reproducible way of **coding ape gestures and combination of signals exchanges** 

We provide 

  * detailed tutorials
  * ELAN templates
  * coding schemes
  * coding examples and 
  * Excel output
  
to promote data sharing and reproducibility, and to facilitate inter-coder reliability. 

This coding scheme can easily be **adapted to your own research question** and study species and aims at filling in the “gaps” between studies and methodologies when it comes to the study of animal signalling. 

We also provide a **new software called elan_finder**, that allows to find specific occurrences and annotations in your entire ELAN database, to preview them and extract them in a spreadsheet format.
