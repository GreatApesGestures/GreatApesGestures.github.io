We define a gesture as a mechanically ineffective physical movement of the limbs or head, directed towards a specific recipient and that is used in a ‘goal-directed’ way to influence the recipient’s behavior in a desired way. Body signals are defined in similar terms for physical movements or postures of the whole body (that can be part of the species typical repertoire such as sexual invitation postures or display behaviours). 

To qualify as ‘goal-directed’, a gesture or body signal has to be accompanied by 

(a) <ins>audience checking</ins> (signaller looks at recipient before or during gesturing), <br>
(b) <ins>response waiting</ins> (signaller pauses and maintains visual contact with recipient after gesturing) or <br>
(c) <ins>persistence</ins> and/or <ins>elaboration</ins> (following response waiting, signaller repeats same signal or uses new signal or combination of signals).


For each gesture (and body signal), we determined the sensory modality as ‘silent-visible’, ‘audible’ or ‘tactile’.
