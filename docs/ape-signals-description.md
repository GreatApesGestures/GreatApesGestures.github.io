## Ape vocalisations

| Vocalisation | Description | Context of production | Illustration
|:--------|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|

|High hoots|High-pitched long-distance call, like a ‘waah’ |Long distance communication, can be used to communicate between parties and given in response to external disturbance or excitement (e.g.  food arrival) ||
|Contest hoots|Call sequences consisting of an introductory phase (modulated inverted u-shape form), an escalation phase composed of several stereotyped units (unmodulated inverted u-shape), and a let-down phase|Used by males to challenge another individual and display status to others|![Alt text](../assets/images/Contest%20hoot.png)(Genty et al. 2014)|
|Victim screams|High-pitched, with shrill and rasping sounds given at full vocal strength, large number of harmonics and long in duration, accompanied by teeth-baring (complete lip retraction, exposing both teeth and gums, the mouth may be wide open)|Used by victim after conflict or during tantrums||
|Copulation screams|Single or succession of high-frequency squeaks and screams|Used by females during mating events|![Alt text](../assets/images/Copulation%20scream.png)(Clay and Zuberbühler, 2011)|

|Alarm peep|Same as Peeps|Given in response to the discovery of a minor threat, or response to surprise||
|Pout moan (or Whimpers)|Low-pitched, melodious call sounding like a whining “hoo-hoo”27, accompanied by pout face (lips are pursed forward and curled outward in front resulting in circular opening).|Used by infants for requests, used by adults during sexual initiations, food begging, or as a appeasement signal in agonistic interactions. Also used as a request  to stop current activity|(Genty, 2019)|
|Threat Barks|Same as barks|Used during aggressive attacks, or if bothered by another individual approach or behaviour||
|Wieew bark|A single, very loud bark, accompanied by facial expression of wide open mouth. Difficult to distinguish from high hoots|Given in response to alarm or hostility rather than excitement.||
