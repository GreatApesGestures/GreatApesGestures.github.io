 Once you have created your set of tiers, tier types and controlled vocabularies that represent your coding scheme, you can save them as a coding **template** (.etf), that you can reuse later to create new annotation files from your media files library. 

A **template** is an annotation document that is not linked to any media file in particular, for which all tiers, tier types and controlled vocabularies have been preserved but that is empty of annotations.

To create a template file:

  * Go to menu File > Save as Template
