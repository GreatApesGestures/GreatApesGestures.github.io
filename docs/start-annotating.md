## Create tiers

This is not necessary if you are using an existing template, e.g., GApS_coding template.etf

A **tier** is a set of annotations that share the same characteristics (e.g., ID_1 gesture) and corresponds to one of the variables you wish to annotate (e.g., gesture type; vocalization type, etc.).


If you are not using an already existing template file (e.g., GApS_coding template.etf) for which tiers have already been created, or if you wish to add new tiers to the existing template, then you can create your own tiers.

To create new tiers:

  * Go to the menu Tier > Add new tier

  * Then enter a Tier Name (e.g., ID_2_gesture) > Add > Close (to save changes)
