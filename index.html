The aim of this tutorial is to provide a systematic and reproducible way of coding ape gestures and combination of signals with ELAN. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

We describe and detail our GApS (Great Apes Signals) coding scheme, provide our ELAN coding template, some coding examples, signal descriptions, and Excel outputs. <br><br>

Our coding scheme is not intended to be definitive, but to provide a good starting point for coding gestures and signal combinations, to promote data sharing and reproducibility, and facilitate inter-coder reliability. <br><br>

Its aim is to fill in the “gaps” between species, studies and methodologies in the field of animal signalling research. <br><br>

The coding scheme can easily be adapted to any research question and study species. <br><br>
 
We also provide a new innovative open-source software, called 'elan_finder', developed specifically for exploring annotated files in ELAN. It allows you to find specific occurrences and annotations in your entire ELAN database, to preview them and extract them in a spreadsheet format. <br><br>
