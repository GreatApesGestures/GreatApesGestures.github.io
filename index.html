The aim of this manual is to offer a systematic and reproducible way of coding ape gestures and combination of signals exchanges with the help of a tutorial, ELAN templates, coding schemes, coding examples, and Excel output, to promote data sharing and reproducibility, and to facilitate inter-coder reliability. This coding scheme protocol is not intended to be exhaustive, but to provide a good base to start coding gestures and signal combinations. This coding scheme can easily be adapted to your own research question and study species and aims at filling in the “gaps” between studies and methodologies when it comes to the study of animal signalling. We also provide a new tool “ELAN_finder”, that allows to find specific occurrences in your dataset, coded in ELAN, and to then create and extract short illustrative video clips of those specific occurrences.

We will first provide a simplified tutorial on how to get started with ELAN in order to apply our coding scheme, then describe the GApS coding scheme.
